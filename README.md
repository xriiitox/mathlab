# !~mathlab
the worst esolang ever

calculates math functions and prints out ascii

# REQUIRES SYMPY TO BE INSTALLED

```!~mathlab``` is required at the start of every file

The file extension for !~mathlab is .776584

I will not elaborate


ANyway; there are multiple functions you can use.

- Factorial: ```(number)!;```
- Exponent: ```(number)^(number);```
- Multiplication: ```(number)*(number);```
- Square root: ```sqrt (number);```
- Cube Root: ```cbrt (number);```
- Logarithm: ```log (base) (number);```
- Random Number: ```rand ;``` (not a typo)
- Limit: ```lim x (x approach;)```

I tried to add trig and it didn't work

Limits work technically but the function has to be x.

Example program is included, as ```hello.776584```

It can be run with ```python3 main.py hello.776584```
